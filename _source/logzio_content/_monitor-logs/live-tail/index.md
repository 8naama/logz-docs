Live Tail gives you a live view of your logs as they come into Logz.io, eliminating the need to SSH into a remote machine.

To start, click **Live Tail** in the main menu, type a regex in the **Match** and **Ignore** fields, press <i class="li li-play"></i> (Play), and watch your logs come in.

Log lines that meet your Match and Ignore criteria are shown in real time.

##### Start, stop, scroll, and clear

The **Clear** and **Scroll** buttons are below the tool bar, on the right of the Live Tail view.

![Start/Stop and Clear buttons]()

* To play, press <i class="li li-play"></i> in the toolbar

* To stop scrolling so you can read a line, press <i class="li li-stop"></i> or scroll with your mouse or trackpad.

* To go to the bottom of the current view and resume scrolling, press <i class="li li-scroll"></i>

* To clear your logs from Live Tail, click <i class="li li-clear"></i>

##### Find and highlight terms

* To show all instances of a term in yellow, type the term in the **Find** box

* To highlight different phrases, click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> (Settings), and then type the word or phrase you want to highlight. You can add as many highlighted terms as you need. To remove a highlight, click the highlighted term in the toolbar.
