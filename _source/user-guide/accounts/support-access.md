If you need help in your account that we can't resolve over chat or email, the Logz.io Support team may request access to your account.

You can control support access from [**<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > General**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) in the top menu.

![Account settings](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/general--account-settings.png)

To enable support access, toggle the switch to **Enabled**, choose an expiration period, and click **Update**.

Once the expiration date passes, support access will automatically be disabled.
If you set the expiration date to `forever`, support access will remain enabled until you disable it or set a new expiration period.

## What access am I granting?

Great question!

When you enable support access, you're granting full administrator permissions to our Support team.
This allows us to troubleshoot issues as quickly as possible.

You can disable this access at any time.
