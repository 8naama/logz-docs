When auto-parsing is not enough, you'll need custom parsing solutions. Your best option depends on your needs. 

* Refine and fine-tune 
  Get finer details using the [data parsing wizard]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/mapping-and-parsing/data-parsing-wizard.html).

  This is great when you want to further customize your data mappings, break up fields and GROK particulars out of longer strings. 
  For example, extract the HTTP response codes (200, 201, 404...) for quick visualization and comparison.


* Custom parsing from scratch 

  Anything unique such as application logs is likely to require custom parsing. <a class="intercom-launch" href="mailto:help@logz.io">Reach out to Logz.io Support</a>." to learn more.
