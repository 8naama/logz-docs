A count of security events concerning access, threats, audit, and endpoint security are listed at the top. This is a count of events triggered by rules tagged as **access**, **threat**, **audit**, and **endpoint**, respectively.

An interactive map shows the origin of attackers across the world and clusters them by their level of activity.

A graph of events over time indicates the number of events that registered over the past 24 hours. It can give you an immediate sense of activity peaks and provide warning of an active attack. By observing changes in the frequency and number of events, you'll be able to immediately spot unusual activity.


Moving down the page, you can see the number of events and how many unique rules were triggered.
Additionally, you can see the rules broken down by severity and a list of the log messages generated by the events.
