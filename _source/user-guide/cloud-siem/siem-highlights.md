Cloud SIEM will help your team get notified automatically about issues demanding immediate attention and manage the system's security posture and prioritize threats and security incidents in a single platform.


### Threat Intelligence

Cross reference incoming logs with threat feeds to identify malicious IPs, DNSs, and URLs.

Logz.io Cloud SIEM enriches security by using industry accepted Threat Intelligence feeds containing lists of known or potential bad actors on the Internet. Logs sent to Logz.io are scanned for appearances of any IOCs (Indicator of Compromise) and enriched when they are found.

### Pre-built Rules and Dashboards

Use pre-configured security rules and monitoring dashboards to start identifying threats immediately.
Logz.io's dedicated team of security experts adds rules and dashboards on a regular basis and provides ongoing customer support.

Each integration includes a set of pre-configured security rules and dashboards that will kick-off your implementation. These dashboards can form the basis of your operations and be further configured and expanded. However, even on day one, you'll benefit from a fully configured SIEM that will save your team the effort of configuring hundreds of alerts and dashboards.

### Relevant notifications

You can configure your own notification settings and threshold triggers on any security rule to stay notified in real time of security incidents.

### Reports and Compliance

Built-in reports, rules and integrations will help you comply with regulatory standards such as PCI and GDPR requirements. You can schedule reports to auto-generate for audit and oversight purposes.
