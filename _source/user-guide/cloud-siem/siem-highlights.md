Drastically reduce threat detection time and mean-time-to-response and prioritize threats across your systems more effectively with Cloud SIEM.


### Threat Intelligence

Cloud SIEM cross references incoming logs against industry-recommended threat feeds to identify malicious IPs, DNSs, and URLs.

Cloud SIEM uses the same application logs used for monitoring production issues to find security threats and issues.
Logs are scanned for appearances of IOCs (Indicator of Compromise) and enriched when they are found.


### Geolocation enrichment

Cloud SIEM adds geolocation enrichment for malicious and suspected IPs, DNSs, and URLs. Out-of-the-box dashboards include threat geolocation maps to make it easy to pin the spread of threat origins.


### Pre-configured Rules and Dashboards

Pre-configured security rules and monitoring dashboards make it simple to start identifying threats straight away.
Logz.io's dedicated team of security experts adds rules and dashboards on a regular basis and provides ongoing customer support.

You can configure your own notification settings and threshold triggers on any security rule to stay notified in real time of security incidents.

### Integrations

Benefit from a fully configured SIEM that will save your team the effort of configuring hundreds of alerts and dashboards.

Each integration includes a set of pre-configured security rules and dashboards. 
Dashboards can form the basis of your security operations and can be further expanded. 


### Reports and Compliance

Built-in reports, rules and integrations will help you comply with regulatory standards such as PCI and GDPR requirements. You can schedule reports to auto-generate for audit and oversight purposes.
