Drastically reduce threat detection time and mean-time-to-response. Cloud SIEM is an essential tool to help prioritize threats across system and security tools more effectively.


### Extensive security observability at no effort

Pre-configured security rules and monitoring dashboards make it simple to start identifying threats straight away.
The list of rules and dashboards is continuously expanding and Logz.io's dedicated team of security experts adds content and improvements on a regular basis.

You can configure your own notification settings and threshold triggers on any security rule to stay notified in real time of security incidents.

### Quick set up

Benefit from an extensive, fully configured SIEM that will save your team the effort of configuring hundreds of alerts and dashboards.

Each integration includes a set of pre-configured security rules and dashboards, that can form the basis of your security operations. You can make additional changes to any existing rules, dashboards, and reports to further expand on them.

### Threat Intelligence

Cloud SIEM cross references incoming logs against industry-recommended threat feeds to identify malicious IPs, DNSs, and URLs.

Cloud SIEM uses the same application logs used for monitoring production issues to find security threats and issues.
Logs are scanned for appearances of IOCs (Indicator of Compromise) and enriched when they are found.


### Geolocation enrichment

Cloud SIEM adds geolocation enrichment for malicious and suspected IPs, DNSs, and URLs. Out-of-the-box dashboards include threat geolocation maps to make it easy to pinpoint threats by their place of origin.

### Reports and Compliance

Built-in reports, rules and integrations will help you comply with regulatory standards such as PCI and GDPR requirements. You can schedule reports to auto-generate for audit and oversight purposes.


### Dedicated support from security experts

Benefit from ongoing security guidance from Logz.io's team of security experts and get access to world-class customer support.

### Extended retention

Cloud SIEM retains logs of any triggered security rules for 10 years! This timeframe will allow you to develop and implement processes and keep records for future reference.
