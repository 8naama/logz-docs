Logz.io Cloud SIEM will help you detect threats and investigate security incidents as soon as you start sending logs.
Here's how your Cloud SIEM will get you there.

The Cloud SIEM is built on top of the ELK Stack so teams can use familiar analytics tools for securing their environments.

Cloud SIEM will help you set priorities and decide which events to investigate first based on their severity, threat level, and by correlating them with industry-standard threat intelligence feeds. Cloud SIEM will help you reduce mean-time-to-response and improve team productivity.


### Start identifying threats immediately

Pre-configured security rules and monitoring dashboards make it simple to start identifying threats straight away.
The list of rules and dashboards is continuously expanding and Logz.io's dedicated team of security experts adds content and improvements on a regular basis.

You can configure your own notification settings and threshold triggers for any security rule to stay notified in real time of security incidents.

### Threat Intelligence

Cloud SIEM cross references incoming logs against industry-recommended threat feeds to identify malicious IPs, DNSs, and URLs.

Cloud SIEM uses the same application logs used for monitoring production issues to find security threats and issues.
Logs are scanned for appearances of IOCs (Indicator of Compromise) and enriched when they are found.


### Drilldowns

Investigate events using drilldown links that direct you to the relevant dashboard.


### Reports

Generate scheduled reporting for audits and to track progress over time.

### Compliance

Cloud SIEM helps you comply with regulatory standards such as GDPR and PCI using built-in reports, rules, and dashboards.


### Dedicated support from security experts

Benefit from ongoing security guidance from Logz.io's team of security experts and get access to world-class customer support.

### Extended retention

Cloud SIEM retains logs of any triggered security rules for 10 years! This extended timeframe ensures that your company retains information long enough to investigate incidents and be covered in case of inquiries.
