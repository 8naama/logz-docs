SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is a broad term, with different implementations that all share one concept: A Cloud SIEM is a security auditing system that funnels info and alerts from numerous security services into a single observability platform.

Logz.io Cloud SIEM is just that - it allows a small team to oversee a large cloud infrustructure. The only prerequisite is "plugging in" all of your company's security services and products into the SIEM, by making the necessary configurations to ship the logs to Logz.io. The rest happens automatically, without requiring intense efforts. Logz.io Cloud SIEM integrates with dozens of security firewalls, container security products, and more, by providing security rules and dashboards for instant observability.

Logz.io Cloud SIEM can convert a sprawling mass of security operations into a single security observability platform.
