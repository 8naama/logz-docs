Threat intelligence,

Logz.io Cloud SIEM (_Security Information and Event Management_) is a security system that funnels info and alerts from numerous security services into a single observability platform.

Logz.io Cloud SIEM integrates with dozens of security services, including firewalls, end point security, network security, identity management security, and even container security.
You can simply turn on Cloud SIEM to enrich the logs youâ€™re already sending with security information to identify malicious activity. If you want to take it up a notch, you can ship logs from more of your company's security services and products to benefit even more. The rest happens automatically, requiring little effort on your part.

Your Cloud SIEM will help you convert a sprawling mass of security operations into a single security observability platform, and allow any team, regardless of its size, to oversee even the largest cloud infrastructures at scale.
