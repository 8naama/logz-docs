Aggregate and investigate security threats from across your cloud from a single observability platform. 

Logz.io Cloud SIEM can use the same application logs used for monitoring production issues to find security threats and issues. But the more security-related logs you ship to Logz.io, the more benefit you will get from your SIEM. 

Logz.io Cloud SIEM is a security observability platform that aggregates security logs, alerts, threat intelligence, and more from dozens of security services and pools them into a single observability platform.

Cloud SIEM can drastically reduce threat detection time and MTTR by cutting back

even the largest cloud infrastructures at scale





Cloud SIEM (_Security Information and Event Management_) is a security system that funnels info and alerts from numerous security services into a single observability platform.

Logz.io Cloud SIEM integrates with dozens of security services, including firewalls, end point security, network security, identity management security, and even container security.
You can simply turn on Cloud SIEM to enrich the logs youâ€™re already sending with security information to identify malicious activity. If you want to take it up a notch, you can ship logs from more of your company's security services and products to benefit even more. The rest happens automatically, requiring little effort on your part.

Your Cloud SIEM will help you convert a sprawling mass of security operations into a single security observability platform, and allow any team, regardless of its size, to oversee even the largest cloud infrastructures at scale.
