Logz.io Cloud SIEM (_Security Information and Event Management_) aggregates security logs and alerts across distributed environments to allow your team to investigate security incidents from a single observability platform.

Cloud SIEM comes fully configured to save your team the effort of configuring hundreds of alerts and dashboards. Each integration includes a set of pre-configured security rules and dashboards that can form the basis of your security operations. You can further edit and expand on any existing rules, dashboards, and reports as you see fit.

Logz.io Cloud SIEM integrates with dozens of security services, including firewalls, end point security, network security, identity management security, and even container security. Simple step-by-step shipping [instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/cloud-siem/integrations/) make it simple to get the data into Logz.io.

You can simply turn on Cloud SIEM to enrich logs with security information to identify malicious activity. If you want to take it up a notch, you can ship logs from more of your company's security services and products to benefit even more. The rest happens automatically.

Your Cloud SIEM will help you convert a sprawling mass of security operations into a single security observability platform, and allow any team, regardless of its size, to oversee even the largest cloud infrastructures at scale.
