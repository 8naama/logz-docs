Logz.io Cloud SIEM (_Security Information and Event Management_) is a security auditing system that funnels info and alerts from numerous security services into a single observacbility platform. 

Your Cloud SIEM will help you convert a sprawling mass of security operations into a single security observability platform, and allow any team, regardless of its size, to oversee even the largest cloud infrastructures at scale. 

Logz.io Cloud SIEM integrates with dozens of security services, including firewalls, end point security, network security, identity management security, and even container security. The only prerequisite is that you first integrate with all of your company's security services and products by making the necessary configurations to ship their logs to Logz.io. The rest happens automatically, requiring little effort on your part.

Each integration is supported by a set of pre-configured security rules and dashboards that will kick-off your implementation. These templates can form the basis of your operations and be further configured and increased. However, even on day one, you'll benefit from a fully configured SIEM that will save your team the effort of configuring hundreds of alerts and building dashboards.

In addition to the security logs and alerts received from the integrations, Logz.io Cloud SIEM enriches security by using industry accepted Threat Intelligence feeds containing lists of known or potential bad actors on the Internet. All logs are scanned by default for appearances of any of the IOCs (Indicator of Compromise) and alert of them.
