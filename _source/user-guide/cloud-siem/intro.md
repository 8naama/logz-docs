Logz.io Cloud SIEM (_Security Information and Event Management_) is a security auditing system that funnels info and alerts from numerous security services into a single observacbility platform. 

Your Cloud SIEM will help you convert a sprawling mass of security operations into a single security observability platform, and allow any team, regardless of its size, to oversee even the largest cloud infrastructures at scale. 

Logz.io Cloud SIEM integrates with dozens of security services, including firewalls, end point security, network security, identity management security, and even container security. The only prerequisite is that you first integrate with all of your company's security services and products by making the necessary configurations to ship their logs to Logz.io. The rest happens automatically, requiring little effort on your part.
